# EXPERIMENT-01: BUILDING LOGICAL CIRCUITS

## 1. Aim

To design, implement, simplify, and verify combinational logic circuits using Boolean algebra and digital logic gates.

## 2. Boolean Notation

Use the following notation throughout this experiment:

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `!A` | NOT A | `!A` |
| `A & B` | AND | `A & B` |
| `A \| B` | OR | `A \| B` |
| `A ^ B` | XOR | `A ^ B` |
| `A XNOR B` | XNOR | `A XNOR B` |

**Important:** In these equations, `!` means NOT, `&` means AND, `|` means OR, and `^` means XOR. Parentheses determine the order of operations.
